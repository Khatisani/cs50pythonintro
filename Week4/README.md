This was brand new content for me. 
The problems were difficult. 
Especially rpofessor.

I noticed that I don't struggle much with syntax and knowing which functions to use.
But I am always making silly mistakes which take me days to figure out.
Ex. With the bitcoin problem I completely forgot to add my API Key. 
Sometimes its as simple and mispellings.

The problems definitely took me longer than expected to solve. 
Before I move on, I'd like to master libraries though.
I feel like I need more practice. 

Overal, a challenging week.

This is brand new content for me. 
I get confused when I have to use the terminal. 
The problems themselves are not impossible.
But the hints in the course are helping a lot.
