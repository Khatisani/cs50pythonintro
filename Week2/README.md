The probems are starting to throw hands. 
The first 3 were not too bad but it took me a whole week to figure out the last 2. 
I had to watch multiple videos and read lots of transcipts just for 2 problems. 
Learned some new python built in functions once again.
Creating mutliple functions for 1 problem is sill rocking my world but I'll get there. 

Git:
I was informed that at wethinkcode, gitlab is used so from now I will be using gitlab for the practices in the git course. 
I understand the basics.
It has become my favourite thing to do after each project.
When I type my git commands after solving, it feels like a reward. 

Terminal:
Comfortable. 
The black and white is not throwing me off too much anymore.
READING is very important. 

Overall:
I don't want to cry yet and the frustration is not too much. 
I'm okay. I'll work on practising the work before attempting problems.
I'll also practice the functions in a function more to get comfortable.
