Unit tests just might be my favourite thing to do in python. 

I didn't find anything challenging. 
Doing the tests is "fun".

when it comes to using multiple functions and
having a main function that calls the other functions. I still get confused. 
So that is something I still need to work on. 

Overall:
I enjoyed the problem sets
