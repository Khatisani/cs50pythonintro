#week0 journal

content
problems were not difficult. Not too different from the bootcamp content
forgot some syntax
I'm not comfortable with calling a function in a function because when do I use 'print' and not 'return'


terminal 
My biggest challenge
My first week using a terminal. I still need to get used to it. It's strange
My brain likes colours so the whole black and white thing is not helping at all
the comman lines are okay. I don't know them yet but I know when to use which


github/lab
What? 
still learning how to navigate through it
I don't want to rush myself 
Also github plus terminal? Not pretty at all


big big positive is I learned how to use an f-string so yay
learned how to round off in a fancy way
