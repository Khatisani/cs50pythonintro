The content covered is not yet difficult for me to understand.
Nothing I haven't seen yet. 
I did the python course from wtc channel on IBMSkillsbuild to prepare for the bootcamp. So I have some notes on it. 
My hack for exception handling is figuring the code as if there are no exceptions and then once it runs, I add in the exceptions. 
I did lots of debugging using the print statement and the built in tool in vs code. 
Sometimes my codes would not pass the checking because of stupid mistakes that would take me days to figure out.
I love the python indentation. It makes long lines of code still look neat. 


GitLab:
Pushing is fun!!
Can I say I am 100% confortable? Not yet. 
The course covers a lot of content and I'm trying to get through it without rushing.
There are lots of new words in each new lesson which means more things to learn.
It's kinda boring. 

Terminal:
Not so scary anymore. 
I'm defineteky used to it now. 

Overall
It was a difficult week. It wasn't scary, just challenging.
