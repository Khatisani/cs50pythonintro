!!!!To BE EDITED!!!!

Content
Learned 'startswith' function
Nothing hectic yet. Still super chilled 
What a confidence booster

Terminal
Getting comfortable with terminal
The black and white is still throwing me off,
at least I still have colours when coding 
Learning to READ the output it gives me

Git
Getting comfortable with git commands and pushing to git instead of manually editing in git 
I now have a favourite command: git status
Gitlab course is straightforward but have to translate to github

Overall
Solid week, I'm happy
