Learned 'startswith' function and 'endswith' function.
Nothing hectic yet. What a confidence booster.
I struggled with the last question. 
This function in a function is still killing me a little.
Learned to split a string and assign variables 
to the different split part

Terminal:
Getting comfortable with terminal. 
The black and white is still throwing me off,
at least I still have colours when coding.
Learning to READ the output it gives me

Git:
Getting comfortable with git commands and pushing to git instead of manually editing in git.
I don't know the commands by head yet.
I still ned to look at my notes.
I now have a favourite command: git status.
Gitlab course is straightforward but have to translate to github.

Overall:
Solid week, I'm happy. Need to work on multiple functions.
